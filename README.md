## Uptech GrowthBook SDK Flutter Wrapper

This project is a thin wrapper around the [GrowthBook Flutter SDK](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook) so that we
can use the [GrowthBook][] service to manage feature toggles while also being
able to manage toggle states properly within automated test suites.

## Development

Get dependencies

```
npm i
